Dear colleagues, we invite you to the first session for an exciting new meeting: Medical AI Journal Club. 
Our goal is to create a virtual club to discuss the latest developments in the field of AI in medicine.
This will be a participant-driven journal club and we will cover papers in form of lightning talks and deep dive and discussion. 
All NYU affiliates are welcome. It will be fun!

## Tentative meeting format

Multiple lightining talks each for 5 minutes, covering papers.
Followed by a deep dive and discussion segment.
We will also discuss cool grants (if any) within the related area.

We strongly encourage departments to each take over the sessions, champion talks from reserachers with their groups and be part of the leadership of this club.
